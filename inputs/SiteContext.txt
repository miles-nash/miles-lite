Miles Nash — Professional & Personal Development Timeline

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🧒 Early Spark (Middle & High School | Colorado)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Attended a Maker Faire at age 12 — sparked a lifelong curiosity with how things work.
• Mowed lawns to fund a 3D printer → launched a fidget spinner business at school (shut down by dean).
• Founded high school robotics club → scaled to 30+ members, raised $12K, podiumed at State.
• Won Lockheed Martin hovercraft hackathon → led to 3 consecutive summer internships in advanced systems.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎓 UC Berkeley — EECS Major (2 years)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Studied Electrical Engineering & Computer Science — focused on systems, hardware/software integration, and ethics.
• Took courses like EE105 (Analog Circuits), EE151 (Digital IC Design), CS168 (Networking), EECS149 (Embedded Systems).
• Notable project: Built full TCP stack in Python using POX framework — implemented out-of-order reassembly, RTO per RFC 6298.
• Developed a campus zine (*People’s Prompt*) to spark public dialogue on AI’s societal impact.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🚗 Tesla — Hardware TPM (1-year break from Berkeley)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Managed wireless entry systems for Model Y — interfaced across software, hardware, supply chain.
• Owned program execution across teams — gained deep insight into high-stakes manufacturing & iterative development at scale.
• Saw the dark side of speed: innovation clashing with worker well-being and systemic inequities.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔁 Return to Berkeley (Final Year)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Returned for community and exploration — balanced technical rigor with reflection.
• Took ENGIN 157 (Engineering, Environment & Society) — explored tech’s human and environmental implications.
• Read widely, wrote freely, built with intention.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
☁️ Microsoft — TPM Intern (Current)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Intern on Cloud Operations & Innovation team — working on infra-scale AI-native tools and systems.
• Experimenting with internal AI workflows and developer efficiency at scale.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🧪 Personal Projects & Identity Work
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• People’s Prompt → Creative AI zine & public media project. (peoplesprompt.org)
• Hands-Free Copilot → Local voice-powered AI agent for task automation.
• Personal Site → Digital studio inspired by Gwern.net, GSD, and MIT Media Lab — in development.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🏁 Ongoing Themes
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
→ Making the abstract tangible.  
→ Finding clarity in ambiguity.  
→ Navigating systems — technical, social, and philosophical — with curiosity and courage.
