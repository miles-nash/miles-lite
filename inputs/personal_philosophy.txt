Miles in a nutshell

PSYCHOLOGY
- Restless Engineer: most alive turning ideas into tangible artifacts—TCP stacks, robotics club, zines.
- Clarity‑seeker in chaos: energized by frontier ambiguity (AI, energy, UI) yet imposes rapid‑iteration frameworks.
- Growth mindset with competitive edge: trades stability for accelerated learning and impact (Tesla drop‑out, Microsoft TPM).
- Systems thinker & storyteller: zooms between low‑level tech and the narrative "why," rallying collaborators and investors.

PHILOSOPHY
- Technology as leverage for human potential: "bicycles for the mind" outlook; AI/hardware to augment people.
- Meritocratic optimism tempered by ethics: champions high standards & agency, but mindful of equitable outcomes.
- Adventure over comfort: snowboarding, hackathons, bold moves—complacency feels like risk.
- Build → Learn → Share: documents, open‑sources, teaches (People's Prompt) because unused insight feels wasted.

INSPIRATIONS
- Makers & visionaries: Steve Jobs' product intuition, Jony Ive's craft, YC founders' scrappy velocity.
- Nature & exploration: Colorado outdoors and "wandering figure" ASCII art for mental space.
- Cross‑disciplinary polymaths: Musk's hardware tempo, Bret Victor's UI provocations, Balaji's network‑state ideas.
- Communities of practice: Cal Band camaraderie, Berkeley AI circles, YC AI Startup School power collective momentum.

META‑PATTERN
Thrives at the intersection of ambitious tech and human narrative—turning raw capability into stories, products, and movements that nudge the future.
