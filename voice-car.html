                <p>Built a voice-controlled car using Arduino microcontroller, Bluetooth HC-05 module, and L298N motor driver. Implemented voice recognition for movement commands including forward, backward, left, right, and stop.</p>
                <p>Features include obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensors, smooth motor control with PWM, and wireless communication for remote operation. The system processes voice commands through a mobile app and translates them into precise motor movements.</p>
